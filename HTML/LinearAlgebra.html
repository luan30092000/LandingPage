		<body>In machine learning, linear algebra is a mathematical framework used to represent and manipulate data and models, with a focus on linear equations and their properties. It is used to perform operations such as matrix multiplication, linear regression, and principal component analysis (PCA) that form the basis of many machine learning algorithms. Linear algebra provides a foundation for understanding and working with complex systems of equations that arise in machine learning, enabling efficient computation and optimization of models to make accurate predictions and decisions.</body>
