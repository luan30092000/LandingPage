		<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by non-human animals and humans. Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.</p>

		<ol>General Application:
			<li><strong>Image and speech recognition</strong>: AI can analyze and understand images and sounds, recognizing patterns and identifying objects, people, and speech.</li>
			<li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong>: AI can analyze and understand human language, enabling applications such as chatbots, machine translation, and sentiment analysis.</li>
			<li><strong>Predictive analytics</strong>: AI can analyze large datasets to identify patterns and make predictions, enabling applications such as predictive maintenance, fraud detection, and personalized marketing.</li>
			<li><strong>Robotics</strong>: AI can enable machines to perform complex tasks that require perception, manipulation, and decision-making, such as autonomous driving, manufacturing, and logistics.</li>
			<li><strong>Personalization</strong>: AI can personalize recommendations and experiences based on individual preferences and behavior, improving customer engagement and satisfaction.</li>
			<li><strong>Healthcare</strong>: AI can assist doctors in diagnosis and treatment by analyzing medical data and providing insights and recommendations.</li>
			<li><strong>Gaming</strong>: AI can play games and learn from experience, improving its performance over time and providing a challenge for human players.</li>
		<p ><em>These are just a few examples of what AI can do, and the applications of AI are continually expanding and evolving as the technology advances.</em></p>
