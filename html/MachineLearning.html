		<body>Machine learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that "learn" â€“ that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks.[1] It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.</body>

		<ol>General steps:
			<li><strong>Data Collection</strong>: Collect and compile the data you will use for your model. This can come from a variety of sources, such as public datasets or proprietary data you have collected yourself.</li>
			<li><strong>Data Preprocessing</strong>: Clean, transform, and prepare the data for use in a machine learning model. This can include tasks such as removing missing values, scaling and normalizing features, and feature engineering.</li>
			<li><strong>Splitting Data</strong>: Split the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance.</li>
			<li><strong>Model Selection</strong>: Choose the appropriate machine learning algorithm for the problem you are trying to solve. This can depend on various factors such as the type of data, the task at hand, and the desired output.</li>
			<li><strong>Model Training</strong>: Train the model using the training data. This involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize a loss function that measures the difference between the model's predictions and the actual outcomes.</li>
			<li><strong>Model Evaluation</strong>: Evaluate the model's performance using the testing data. This can include metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, depending on the type of problem you are trying to solve.</li>
			<li><strong>Model Tuning</strong>: Fine-tune the model by adjusting the hyperparameters to improve its performance.</li>
			<li><strong>Model Deployment</strong>: Deploy the model to a production environment, making sure to monitor its performance and retrain it periodically if necessary.</li>
	<em>These steps are not necessarily linear and may involve multiple iterations before arriving at a satisfactory solution. Additionally, the specific techniques and tools used in each step may vary depending on the problem and data at hand.</em>
